### Creating an issue

You've found a bug in the source code or maybe
you'd like a new feature?
You can help us by
[submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/starknet-id/starknet.quest/issues).
Before you create an issue, make sure to search the issue archive -- your issue
may have already been addressed!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what
  environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.

**Even better: Submit a pull request with a fix or new feature!**

### Understanding the labels on your Pull Request
- If your PR is ready for review or merging then add a label which says - **Ready for Review**
- If your PR is in progress and is not ready for review or merging then add a label which says - **In progress do not merge**
- If the maintainer has reviewed and has asked for a change then they would attach the label - **Changes Requested**. You can address the comments made in the review and add the label **Ready for review** once done so that they can come back to it later and complete the review and merge ðŸŽ‰
